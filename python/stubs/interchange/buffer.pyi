    Data in the buffer is guaranteed to be contiguous in memory.

    Note that there is no dtype attribute present, a buffer can be thought of
    as simply a block of memory. However, if the column that the buffer is
    attached to has a dtype that's supported by DLPack and ``__dlpack__`` is
    implemented, then that dtype information will be contained in the return
    value from ``__dlpack__``.

    This distinction is useful to support both data exchange via DLPack on a
    buffer and (b) dtypes like variable-length strings which do not have a
    fixed number of bytes per element.
