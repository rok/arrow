def cpu_count() -> int:
    """
    Return the number of threads to use in parallel operations.

    The number of threads is determined at startup by inspecting the
    ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` and ``OMP_THREAD_LIMIT`` environment variables.
    If neither is present, it will default to the number of hardware threads
    on the system. It can be modified at runtime by calling
    :func:`set_cpu_count()`.

    --------
    set_cpu_count : Modify the size of this pool.
    io_thread_count : The analogous function for the I/O thread pool.

def set_cpu_count(count: int) -> None:

    Set the number of threads to use in parallel operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    count : int
        The number of concurrent threads that should be used.

    If it isn't enabled, then python shouldn't create any
    threads either, because we're probably on a system where
    threading doesn't work (e.g. Emscripten).
